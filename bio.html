						<p>Peter DiStefano is an internationally known guitarist, songwriter, producer and
							composer. In 1993, as a guitarist he joined Jane’s Addiction vocalist Perry Farrell, drummer
							Stephen Perkins, and bassist Martyn LeNoble to form the alternative-rock band, Porno for
							Pyros. The group released their self- titled debut album that year. It reached #3, achieved
							gold status and included the hit single, "Pets”.</p>
						<p>Their second album, “Good God's Urge”, was released in 1996. Peter’s daring and complex
							guitar style was an enormous part of what made the band a huge success.</p>
						<p>In 1997, Perry and Stephen became involved with a Jane's Addiction reunion tour,
							putting Porno for Pyros on hold. Meanwhile, Pete conquered drug and alcohol addictions and
							beat life threatening cancer. During these challenging personal times, he continued to play
							guitar and produce music with Rambient, Hellride, Venice Underground, and toured with Bauhaus
							singer Peter Murphy.</p>
						<p>Since then Peter has released five successful solo albums and collaborated on dozens of
							other bands’ projects. Peter’s unique guitar playing is featured in many of composer Harry
							Gregson-Williams’ remarkable film scores such as “The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian”,
							“The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe”, “Gone Baby Gone”, “Déjà Vu”,
							“Shrek 3”, “Domino” and “Man on Fire”.</p>
						<p>In 2007, Peter toured with the progressive electronic UK band, Hybrid. Peter will
							continue to perform with them on the Warped Tour and Lollapalooza in 2008.</p>
						<p>Recently, he has composed the film scores for the feature documentaries, “Giving It Up”
							directed by Frank Guy and “Live” directed by David Parsa. In 2008, he completed the film
							score and additional songs for Marc Clebanoff’s gritty thriller, “Break”, starring Frank
							Krueger, Sarah Thompson, James Russo, Michael Madsen and David Carradine.</p>
						<p>In 2009 and 2010 he built a state of the art music studio in Santa Monica CA. Art
							Linson and John Linson are his partners in the studio.</p>
						<p>In 2011 he joined forces with Kamal Soliman and Bill Sarver in the new and exciting
							project, Lance Herbstrong. They have been on tour for a year and a half and have made two
							groundbreaking records. Both of their singles have gone to #1 on Twitter music and Peter is
							enjoying the successful ride that is Lance Herbstrong.</p>
